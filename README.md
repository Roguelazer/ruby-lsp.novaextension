**Ruby** provides [ruby-lsp](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby-lsp) LSP support for Ruby.

This was forked from [ruby.novaextension](https://github.com/tdegrunt/ruby.novaextension), which provides [solargraph](https://solargraph.org/) support if you'd prefer to use solargraph.

## Requirements

Ruby requires some additional tools to be installed on your Mac:

- [ruby-lsp](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby-lsp)

This extension cannot use ruby-lsp from your bundle; it must be installed system-wide

## Example
